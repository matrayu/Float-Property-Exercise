To practice the float settings we just discussed, we'd like you to spend up to but no more than 20 minutes attempting to code up the design below.

Fork this repl.it. While you may need to add classes to the HTML to complete this exercise, you should not add or remove any HTML elements.

Requirements
Fork this repl.it, and start coding up the design. Remember, click and drag the bar separating the Editor from the Output to the left to see how the designs look in a full browser window.
Submit a link below to the repl.it. When you submit your project link, your mentor will be notified to check out your work.

Limit yourself to twenty minutes for this exercise. If you can't complete it by then have a look at the solution below, and even if you do complete it within twenty minutes, still have a look and compare your code to the solution below.
